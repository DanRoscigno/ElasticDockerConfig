# ElasticDockerConfig

Docker compose YAML to deploy the Elastic Stack.  As I add more components to my deployment I will add more to the YAML file.

The docker image for Kibana can by pulled by following the instructions here:

https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.1/_pulling_the_image.html

The YAML I am using is built up from the docs at Elastic's website, I am just putting it all together.
